# Welcome to Davin's Food Page

I love trying and eating food so I'm making this food page. There are many places that I love to eat at, but I'm sharing two that are great and that I'm always finding myself going back too

## Pho Tasty

The address of this place is 19117 Pioneer Blvd, Artesia, CA 90701. This place is a great place if your looking for some Vietnamese noodle, I often order food here. There food is delicious, everything about the pho is great the broth tastes great and if you add some toppings on it, it becomes even better. Also, this place is still open during the pandemic, but its takeout only. For some other reviews you can check out the link [here.](https://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-tasty-artesia)

## Sweetee Thai

The address of this place is 11700 South St #101, Artesia, CA 90701. This place is close by and has some great thai food. I especially love to order the Pad See Ew whcih are stir fried noodles and I also love the Thai Boat Noodles. Everything from the noodles to the soup in the Thai Boat are amazing. I would definitely recommend. Also, this place is still open today during the pandemic. For more reviews click [here.](https://www.yelp.com/biz/sweetee-thai-cafe-artesia)
